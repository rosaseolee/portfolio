### Machine Learning Classification using Python - Precision and Recall
[Project Repo](https://github.com/rosaseolee/portfolio/tree/main/Classification_Python)

Used Python to build a machine learning model to predict star ratings for product reviews based on their textual content and additional features. Using a combination of TF-IDF vectorization, sentiment analysis, and numeric feature scaling, the model leverages a Random Forest classifier to achieve this goal. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the model's performance.
